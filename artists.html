                Maxie Lee Ryles III, known professionally as Fivio Foreign, is an American rapper and songwriter from Brooklyn, New York. 
                Born on March 29, 1996, Fivio gained widespread recognition with his breakout single "Big Drip" in 2019. 
                You could argue that Fivio has been THE artist to bring drill to mainstream culture. After Pop Smoke passed a couple years back, Fivio took over as the king of New York
                and has been carrying the drill industry on his back since. He has been known for his catchy ad-libs and embodies drill music.
